# Library Management System

A library management system that allows admins to add collections and users to borrow books.

## Design Approach
The development process started with designing the database structure using an Entity-Relationship (ER) diagram. The ER diagram helped in structuring the data and relationships between entities. The database was then implemented online using **Supabase**, which provides a PostgreSQL backend.

## Features
- **Admin**: Manage collections and books in the library.
- **User**: Browse, borrow, and return books.

## Installation
Clone the repository:
```bash
